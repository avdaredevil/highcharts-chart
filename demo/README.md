## About this demo
This is a local test demo. So that as features are added, we can check here how they work!

## How to run?
- Make sure to have the polymer CLI installed globally in NPM
- From the folder above, run `npm run dev`
- This will run the `polymer serve` function and provide a `localhost:xxxx` page you can access
- Feel free to make changes and test (by reloading said page in your browser)
